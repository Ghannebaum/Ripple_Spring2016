Ripple Instructions for use(changes may need to be made for non windows systems)
1)go to github.com/Ghannebaum/Ripple_Spring2016 and download the RippleFinal folder

2)once downloaded, open the folder and open RippleStart.txt
RippleStart.txt is a text file containing the information the Ripple code needs for your specific system, with examples of the information that will need to be changed to configure for your system. 

3)Next, connect the Arduinos to the system and upload the coorisponding code to each arduino.
To upload to arduino open the code you want to upload in the arduino software,
ECG/Resp. code is ads1292r_Final
Pulse Ox code is PulseOx_Final,
next select tools from the menubar and ensure the port the arduino is connected to is selected
next select upload

4)Once both arduinos are connected and their coorisponding code has been uploaded the MATLAB GUI program is ready to begin.
Open RippleGUI2.m 
Line 162 is the only line that will need changed between systems, it contains the filepath for the RippleStart.txt file
Update this line with the file path on your system and select start.

5)The gui interface will launch
select start data collection and the program will launch the python code in your system command prompt and begin streaming the data to text files
MATLAB will collect the data from these text files and begin graphing them
If there is a problem check and make sure the RippleStart.txt file has been updated correctly and check line 162 of the MATLAB GUI code is leading to the correct location.
